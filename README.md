# ProxyList

A large collection of proxies organized by ports. This list may contain inaccuracies, and some proxies may not work. It is simply a compilation of proxies I have found and decided to gather.

### Files:

- **socks_proxies.txt**: Contains SOCKS proxies.
- **https_proxies.txt**: Contains HTTPS proxies.
- **other_proxies.txt**: Contains proxies of other types.
- **all_proxies.txt**: Contains all proxies compiled in one file.

Note: Use at your own risk.
